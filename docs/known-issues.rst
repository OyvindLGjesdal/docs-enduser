API access
----------

All new users will get a pass phrase to use with API when they provision
a personal project (see :doc:`login`). We do not have any easy way to recrate
the pass phrase at the moment. If you lose yours please contact us.


Only personal projects
----------------------

We currently have a limitation on projects, in which only personal
projects are supported. If you need a project for more general purpose,
please contact us.

Console limitation
------------------

There is a limitation which requires the environment (e.x. X) to run
in one of the EN locales to get a correct key mapping (whatever the
locale active inside the instance)!
