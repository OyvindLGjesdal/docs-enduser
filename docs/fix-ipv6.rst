Background Information
----------------------

We currently have some issues with routing IPv6 traffic on new instances in OSL. This also affects DNS resolving and boot time. We're working to resolve this as quickly as possible. In the meantime, please consider the following options:

#. Start your instance(s) in BGO
#. Temporarily disable IPv6 after the instances has booted.

Disabling IPv6 on a running instance
------------------------------------

Note that you have to use the dualStack network in order for this to work. Boot time will be considerably longer than usual.

Do the following to disable IPv6 on your instances:

   .. parsed-literal::

     $ **sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1**
     net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
     $ **sudo dhclient eth0**

Then verify the results by checking the network interface and DNS configuration

   .. parsed-literal::
     $ **sudo ip addr show eth0**

   The output should only contain inet configuration and not inet6

   .. parsed-literal::

     $ **cat /etc/resolv.conf**
     ; generated by /usr/sbin/dhclient-script
     search openstacklocal novalocal
     nameserver 129.240.2.40
     nameserver 129.240.2.3
