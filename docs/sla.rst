.. IMPORTANT:: **About this document**
   This document outlines the service level agreement, and what you
   should expect from the NREC infrastructure service.


Availability
------------

NREC services are guaranteed to be available and responsive 99.0%
of the time.

Defining unavailability
-----------------------

A NREC service will be considered unavailable when it is
inaccessible during two or more consecutive 90-second intervals.

Limitations
-----------

A period of unavailability is excluded from the service level
guarantee, if:

* the unavailability is due to scheduled maintenance, provided we
  notify you at least 5 days in advance;

* you are in breach of our terms of service, or your services
  agreement with us, as applicable (including your payment obligations
  to us), or the unavailability is otherwise due to your actions;

* the unavailability is caused by factors outside of our reasonable
  control, including a force majeure event; internet access problems;
  blocking, filtering, or censorship of our services by a government
  or other third party; or other problems beyond our services.
