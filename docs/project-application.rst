Project application
===================

Demo projects
-------------

.. _this web form: https://request.nrec.no

You will be allocated a demo project the first time you logon . This
project is personal and for testing purposes.  There is a limited
quota for this demo project. If you need additional resources or a
project in which you wish to collaborate with other users, please
apply for a standard project using `this web form`_.

Demo projects use excess resources that are usually available under
normal operation, however, if there is a shortage of resources please
note that we may terminate some or all instances running in demo
projects without prior notice.

Quotas are set by region. Projects that haven't been given a quota in
their respective region will be automatically given a default quota.

**Instances**

**vCPU**
  The number of processors (vCPU) available to an instance.

**Memory**

**Number of volumes**
  In NREC, block storage is called volume. The number indicates how many
  volumes are available in a project.

**Volume snapshots**

Standard projects
-----------------

You can apply for a standard project (i.e. not demo) by using `this
web form`_. In this form, you need to give some information about
the project. Most importantly, we separate between personal and shared
projects:

**Personal**
  Personal projects are used by only one user. Only you will have
  access to your personal project.

**Shared**
  Shared projects can have multiple users. Users can be added or
  removed at any time, but access control is done by contacting
  NREC support. In order to add a user, the user must have logged
  in to NREC at least once, else the user isn't known in the
  system.
