.. IMPORTANT:: **About this document**
   You should know what you're getting when you sign up for UH-IaaS,
   and what we expect from you in return. We've tried to keep the
   legalese to a minimum.

Signing up
----------

#. In order to use the UH-IaaS infrastructure service, you must sign
   up with the Dataporten authentication and authorization service.

#. You must have a valid user account at any educational institution
   in Norway that has signed up for using UH-IaaS.

#. You must provide your username, a valid email address, and any
   other information requested in order to complete the signup
   process.

#. When signing up with Dataporten, make sure to note your API key. It
   cannot be retreived afterwards.

#. Please carefully guard the security of your account and monitor use
   of your API keys. You are responsible for all use of the Services
   under your account, whether or not authorized, including any use of
   your API keys.

Our services
------------

.. _Service Level Agreement: sla.html

#. We will make the UH-IaaS services available to you in accordance
   with our `Service Level Agreement`_. Subject to these Terms, we
   grant you a non-exclusive, revocable license and right to:

   * Create and manage virtual machines within your quota limit.
   * Create and manage firewalls and SSH keys for use with your
     virtual machines.
   * Create and manage storage volumes for use with your virtual
     machines.

#. You may only use the Services for non-commercial purposes, for
   research purposes and educational purposes without charge.   

#. If you want to make use of the Services outside this description,
   such as commercial purposes, please contact us.

#. If you need more resources (number of virtual machines, storage
   etc.) than your quota allows, please contact us.

#. Please make sure to free resources that you no longer use or need,
   such as terminating obsolete virtual machines.

Security
--------

#. We will strive to maintain a set of "Golden Images" for popular
   Linux distributions, that are updated at a monthly basis. These
   images will be easily recognizable as they contain the word "GOLD"
   to distinguish them from images uploaded by users.

#. Once you create a virtual machine from an image, the virtual
   machine becomes your responsibility. At a minimum, you should make
   sure that:

   * The operating system running on your virtual machine are updated
     regularly with security patches
   * The virtual machines are rebooted regularly for new patches to
     take effect

#. Please adjust your firewalls (security groups) carefully, allowing
   only necessary traffic to and from your virtual machines.

Ownership of content
--------------------

#. Your content is your content. You retain ownership of all content
   that you place in your personal project.

#. Your associated educational institution may exercise ownership of
   content according to Norwegian law.
